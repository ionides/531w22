1. **Interpretation of a simulation experiment (i.e., a bootstrap)**.
Recall from Chapter 5, slide 17, the following interpretation of a simulation experiment where we repeat the estimation procedure on simulations carried out with parameter value $\hat\theta$.
<br>
<br>
"For large Monte Carlo sample size $J$, the coverage of the proposed confidence interval (CI) is well approximated, for models in a neighborhood of $\hat\theta$, by the proportion of the intervals $\big[\hat\theta^{[j]}_{1,\mathrm lo}, \, \hat\theta^{[j]}_{1,\mathrm hi}\big]$ that include $\hat\theta_1$."
<br>
<br>
How does checking the number of times our estimated parameter value falls within our Monte Carlo simulation CI's tell us anything about the performance of our original CI's?
