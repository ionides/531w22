**Strengths**: Well written; it is nice when a careful data analysis leads the authors to revise their previous expectations. The introduction and conclusion give good contextualization for the analysis. One reviewer was concerned about the gap between talking about home movie-watching and analyzing data on movie theater earnings, but most could see the connection. The supplementary analysis - bootstrap and checking for the consequence of inflation - is worthwhile and adds to the solidity of the project. The coding is done carefully, for example, the numerical results in the report are not hard-coded but are calculated using Rmarkdown. Reviewers found almost no technical errors.

**Points for consideration**:

1. Inconsistent values in the AIC table (not mathematically possible under accurate likelihood maximization and evaluation) should be noted and discussed.
