On the morning of Wednesday 4/20, or soon after, you should receive a Canvas assignment for two final project peer review reports. Summary points from past final review reports can be found at https://ionides.github.io/531w21/final_project/. Reviews are graded according to the same [posted rubric](../rubric_midterm_review.html) as for the midterm.

This is the first time I have carried out peer review through Canvas, so please let me know if anything is not working well or could be done better.

All the projects will be listed at https://ionides.github.io/531w22/final_project/index.html within a day or two, but you should have access to the particular projects you are refereeing via Canvas. Let me know if you do not.

Please submit your review reports as pdf files on Canvas, by  Wednesday 4/27, 11:59pm. The reviews will not be posted publicly, and those who wrote the project should remain blind to your identity. Please do not unblind yourself. It is up to you whether to investigate the identity of the people you are reviewing for. My understanding is that Canvas cannot guarantee "double blind" reviewing, but it is helpful if possible to maintain a "single blind" protocol where the referee is anonymous to the reviewers. Please do not question others on which reports they are reviewing. In other words, treat this process with the same respect expected of professional academic peer review. It is not a major problem if you discover who reviews your work, but the review process works well under anonymity. Each report should be about 1000 words, and should identify the main strengths and weaknesses of the project (from both technical and conceptual perspectives) as well as identifying points with room for improvement. It is appropriate for your report to include comments on coding decisions and reproducibility.
