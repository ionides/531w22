	abstract = {Few studies have assessed incubation periods of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Delta variant. This study aimed to elucidate the transmission dynamics, especially the incubation period, for the Delta variant compared with non-Delta strains. We studied unvaccinated coronavirus disease 2019 patients with definite single exposure date from August 2020 to September 2021 in Japan. The incubation periods were calculated and compared by Mann–Whitney U test for Delta (with L452R mutation) and non-Delta cases. We estimated mean and percentiles of incubation period by fitting parametric distribution to data in the Bayesian statistical framework. We enrolled 214 patients (121 Delta and 103 non-Delta cases) with one specific date of exposure to the virus. The mean incubation period was 3.7 days and 4.9 days for Delta and non-Delta cases, respectively (p-value = 0.000). When lognormal distributions were fitted, the estimated mean incubation periods were 3.7 (95\% credible interval (CI) 3.4–4.0) and 5.0 (95\% CI 4.5–5.6) days for Delta and non-Delta cases, respectively. The estimated 97.5th percentile of incubation period was 6.9 (95\% CI 5.9–8.0) days and 10.4 (95\% CI 8.6–12.7) days for Delta and non–Delta cases, respectively. Unvaccinated Delta variant cases had shorter incubation periods than non–Delta variant cases.},

	abstract = {With the delta variant of COVID-19, known as B.1.617.2, quickly ramping up infections around the world, we need to understand what makes this variant more contagious. One study has reported that the delta variant is 60\% more transmissible than the alpha variant. As of August 2021, the delta variant has quickly become the dominant strain. Despite countries like the US, where most of the population is vaccinated, COVID-19 has made a resurgence in infections. Collectively, as a country, we ask: is it more deadly? What makes it more “contagious” or “transmissible”? This review article delves into the information we already know about the delta variant and how it compares with the other SARS-CoV-2 variants. The current vaccine companies like AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Moderna have reported that their vaccines can provide protection against this variant but with a slightly reduced efficacy. In this article, we do a comprehensive review and summary of the delta B.1.617.2 variant and what makes it more contagious.},
