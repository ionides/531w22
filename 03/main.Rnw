\section{Concepts of stationarity}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Definition: Weak and strong stationarity}

\bi

\item A time series model which is both mean stationary and covariance stationary is \myemph{weakly stationary} or \myemph{second order stationary}.

\item A time series model for which all joint distributions are invariant to shifts in time is \myemph{strongly stationary} or \myemph{strictly stationary}.

\item Formally, this means that for any collection of times $(t_1, t_2,\dots,t_K)$, the joint distribution of observations at these times should be the same as the joint distribution at $(t_1+\tau, t_2+\tau,\dots,t_K+\tau)$ for any $\tau$.

\item For equally spaced observations, this becomes: for any collection of timepoints $n_1,\dots,n_K$, and for any lag $h$, the joint density function of $(Y_{n_1},Y_{n_2},\dots, Y_{n_K})$ is the same as the joint density function of $(Y_{n_1+h},Y_{n_2+h},\dots, Y_{n_K+h})$.

\ei

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\bi
\item In our general notation for densities, this strict stationarity requirement can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}&&f_{Y_{n_1},Y_{n_2},\dots, Y_{n_K}}(y_1,y_2,\dots,y_K)\\
&&\quad\quad = f_{Y_{n_1+h},Y_{n_2+h},\dots, Y_{n_K+h}}(y_1,y_2,\dots,y_K).
\end{eqnarray}

\item Strict stationarity implies weak stationarity (check this). 

\ei

\myquestion. How could we assess whether a weak stationary model is appropriate for a time series dataset?

\answer{\vspace{40mm}}{
Supposed they are equally spaced, we can
\begin{enumerate}
\item calculate average in chunks (for mean stationary)
\item calculate sample ACF in chunks (for covariance stationary)

\section{White noise}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{White noise}

A time series model $\epsilon_{1:N}$ which is weakly stationary with 
\begin{eqnarray} \nonumber
\E[\epsilon_n]&=& 0 
\\ 
\nonumber
\cov(\epsilon_m,\epsilon_n) &=& \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
  \sigma^2, & \mbox{if $m=n$} \\
   0, & \mbox{if $m\neq n$} \end{array}\right. ,
\end{eqnarray}
is said to be \myemph{white noise} with variance $\sigma^2$.
\bi
\item The ``noise'' is because there's no pattern, just random variation. If you listened to a realization of white noise as an audio file, you would hear a static sound.

\item The ``white'' is because all freqencies are equally represented. This will become clear when we do frequency domain analysis of time series.

\item Signal processing---sending and receiving signals on noisy channels---was a motivation for early time series analysis.

\ei

\end{frame} 


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Example: Gaussian white noise}

In time series analysis, a sequence of independent identically distributed (\iid) Normal random variables with mean zero and variance $\sigma^2$ is known as \myemph{Gaussian white noise}. We write this model as
\[
\nonumber 
\epsilon_{1:N} \sim \mathrm{\iid} \, N[0,\sigma^2].
\]
 
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\frametitle{Example: Binary white noise}

Let $\epsilon_{1:N}$ be {\iid} with
\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber
\epsilon_n = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
  1, & \mbox{with probability $1/2$} \\
  -1, & \mbox{with probability $1/2$} \end{array}\right. .
\end{eqnarray}
We can check that $\E[\epsilon_n]=0$, $\myvar(\epsilon_n)=1$ and $\cov(\epsilon_m,\epsilon_n)=0$ for $m\neq n$. Therefore, $\epsilon_{1:N}$ is white noise. 

Similarly, for any $p\in (0,1)$, we could have 
\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber
\epsilon_n = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
  (1-p)/p, & \mbox{with probability $p$} \\
  -1, & \mbox{with probability $1-p$} \end{array}\right. .
\end{eqnarray}

\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\frametitle{Example: Sinusoidal white noise}

\mode<presentation>{
\vspace{-2mm}
}

Let $\epsilon_n = \sin(2\pi n U)$, with a single draw $U\sim\mathrm{Uniform}[0,1]$ determining the time series model for all $n\in 1:N$. We will show this is an example of a weakly stationary time series that is not strictly stationary.

\vspace{2mm}

{\myquestion}. Show that $\epsilon_{1:N}$ is weakly stationary, and is white noise!


\answer{\vspace{50mm}}{
\begin{eqnarray}
\E[\epsilon_n] &=& \int_0^1 \sin(2\pi nu)\, du = -(2\pi n)^{-1}[cos(2\pi nu)]_0^1=0$.
\\
\cov[\epsilon_m\epsilon_n] &=&=\int_0^1 \sin(2\pi nu)\sin(2\pi\mu)\, du
\\
&=& (1/2)\int_0^1[\cos(2\pi(n-m)u)-cos(2\pi(n+m)u)]\, du

\section{Building models using white noise}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\frametitle{Using white noise to build other time series models}

Reminder: Why do we even need time series models?

\bi
\item All statistical tests (i.e., whenever we use data to answer a question) rely on having a model for the data. The model is sometimes called the \myemph{assumptions} for the test.

\item If our model is wrong, then any conclusions drawn from it may be wrong. Our error could be small and insignificant, or disastrous.
 
\item Time series data collected close in time are often more similar than a model with {\iid} variation would predict. We need models that have this property, and we must work out how to test interesting hypotheses for these models.

\ei

\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}[fragile]


\frametitle{The AR(p) autoregressive model}

\bi

\item The order $p$ autoregressive model,  abbreviated to AR(p), is

\vspace{2mm}

[M1] $\quad\quad \quad Y_n = \phi_1 Y_{n-1}+\phi_2Y_{n-2}+\dots+\phi_pY_{n-p} + \epsilon_n$,

\vspace{2mm}

where $\{\epsilon_n\}$ is a white noise process. 


\item Often, we consider the \myemph{Gaussian AR(p)} model, where  $\{\epsilon_n\}$ is a Gaussian white noise process. 

\item M1 is a \myemph{stochastic difference equation}. It is a \link{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation}{difference equation (also known as a recurrence relation)} since each time point is specified recursively in terms of previous time points. Stochastic just means random.


\ei

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\bi

\item To complete the model, we need to \myemph{initialize} the solution to the stochastic difference equation. Supposing we want to specify a distribution for $Y_{1:N}$, we have some choices in how to set up the \myemph{initial values}.

\ei
\begin{enumerate}
   \item We can specify $Y_{1:p}$ explicitly, to get the recursion started.

    \item We can specify $Y_{1-p:0}$ explicitly.

    \item  For either of these choices, we can define these initial values either to be additional parameters in the model (i.e., not random) or to be specified random variables.

    \item If we want our model is strictly stationary, we must initialize so that $Y_{1:p}$ have the proper joint distribution for this stationary model.

\end{enumerate}

\bi

\item Assuming the initialization has mean zero, M1 implies that $\E[Y_n]=0$ for all $n$. For additional generality, we could add a constant mean $\mu$.

\item Let's investigate a particular Gaussian AR(1) process, as an exercise.

\vspace{2mm}

[M2] $\quad\quad \quad Y_n = 0.6 Y_{n-1}+ \epsilon_n$,

\vspace{2mm}

where $\epsilon_n\sim \mathrm{\iid}\, N[0,1]$. We will initialize with $Y_1\sim N[0,1.56]$.

\ei

\end{frame} 




\begin{frame}[fragile]{Simulating an autoregressive model}

\mode<presentation>{
\vspace{-3mm}
}

Looking at simulated sample paths is a good way to get some intuition about a random process model. 
We will do this for the AR(1) model M2.
One approach is to use the \code{arima.sim} function in R.

\mode<presentation>{
\vspace{-1mm}
}

<< ar_arima_sim_code,echo=T,eval=F>>=
set.seed(123456789)

@

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\bi

\item Does your intuition tell you that these simulated data are evidence for a model with a linear trend?

\item The eye looks for patterns in data, and often finds them even when there is no strong statistical evidence. 

\item That is why we need statistical tests!

\item It is easy to see patterns even in white noise. Dependent models produce spurious patterns even more often.

\item Play with simulating different models with different seeds to train your intuition.

\ei

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
We can also simulate model M2 directly by writing the model equation:

\mode<presentation>{
\vspace{-2mm}
}

<< ar_sim_code,echo=T,eval=F>>=
set.seed(123456789)
N <- 100
X <- numeric(N)
X[1] <- rnorm(1,sd=sqrt(1.56))
for(n in 2:N) X[n] <- 0.6 * X[n-1] + rnorm(1)
plot(X,type="l")
points(lag(ar1,-13),col="red",pch=1)
@

<<ar_sim_code>>

\begin{frame}[fragile]

\frametitle{The MA(q) moving average model}

\bi
\item The order $q$ moving average model, abbreviated to MA(q), is

\vspace{2mm}

[M3] $\quad\quad \quad Y_n =  \epsilon_n +\theta_1 \epsilon_{n-1} +\dots+\theta_q\epsilon_{n-q}$,

\vspace{2mm}

where $\{\epsilon_n\}$ is a white noise process. 

\item To fully specify $Y_{1:N}$ we must specify the joint distribution of $\epsilon_{1-q:N}$.

\item Often, we consider the \myemph{Gaussian MA(q)} model, where  $\{\epsilon_n\}$ is a Gaussian white noise process. 

\item In M3, we've defined a zero mean process. We could add a mean $\mu$.

\item Let's investigate a particular Gaussian MA(2) process, as an exercise.

\vspace{2mm}

[M4] $\quad\quad \quad Y_n = \epsilon_n + 1.5\epsilon_{n-1}+\epsilon_{n-2}$,

\vspace{2mm}

where $\epsilon_n\sim \mathrm{\iid} \,  N[0,1]$.
\ei

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[fragile]

\frametitle{Simulating a moving average model}

We simulate M4 using the same methods as for the autoregressive model.

<< ma_sim_code,eval=F,echo=T>>=
N <- 100
set.seed(123456789)
X1 <- arima.sim(list(ma=c(1.5,1)),n=N,sd=1)
set.seed(123456789)
epsilon <- rnorm(N+2)
X2 <- numeric(N)
for(n in 1:N) X2[n] <- epsilon[n+2]+1.5*epsilon[n+1]+epsilon[n]
plot(X1,type="l") ; plot(X2,type="l")
@

<< ma_sim,eval=T,echo=F,fig.width=8,fig.height=2.5,out.width="12cm">>=
oldpars <- par(mfrow=c(1,2))

<<ma_sim_code>>

@

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\code{X1} and \code{X2} look identical. We can check this
<< check>>=
all(X1==X2)
@

Do you agree that the spurious evidence for a trend that we saw for the AR(1) model is still somewhat present for the MA(2) simulation? Let's see if we can also see it in the underlying white noise process:

<< noise_sim_code,echo=T,eval=F>>=
N <- 100
set.seed(123456789)
epsilon <- rnorm(N)
plot(epsilon,type="l")
@

\vspace{-2mm}

<< noise_sim,fig.width=4,fig.height=2.5,out.width="6cm",echo=F,eval=T>>=
par(mai=c(0.8,0.5,0.1,0.1))
<<noise_sim_code>>
@

To me, the trend-like behavior is not visually apparent in the white noise that ``drives'' the AR and MA models.

\end{frame} 


\begin{frame}[fragile]

\frametitle{The random walk model}


\vspace{-3mm}

\bi

\item The \myemph{random walk} model is

\vspace{2mm}

[M5] $\quad\quad\quad Y_n = Y_{n-1} + \epsilon_n$,

\vspace{2mm}

where $\{\epsilon_n\}$ is white noise. Unless otherwise specified, we usually initialize with $Y_0=0$.

\item If $\{\epsilon_n\}$ is Gaussian white noise, then we have a Gaussian random walk.

\item The random walk model is a special case of AR(1) with $\phi_1=1$. 

\item The stochastic difference equation in M5 has an exact solution,
$$ Y_n = \sum_{k=1}^n\epsilon_k.$$

\item We can also call $Y_{0:N}$ an \myemph{integrated white noise process}. We think of summation as a discrete version of integration.

\item If data $\data{y_{1:N}}$ are modeled as a random walk, the value of $Y_0$ is usually an unknown. Rather than introducing an unknown parameter to our model, we may initialize our model at time $t_1$ with $Y_1=\data{y_1}$.

\ei

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\bi
\item The \myemph{first difference} time series $z_{2:N}$ is defined by
\begin{equation}
z_n= \Delta \data{y_n} = \data{y_{n}}-\data{y_{n-1}}
\end{equation}

\item From a time series of length $N$, we only get $N-1$ first differences. 

\item A random walk model for $\data{y_{1:N}}$ is essentially equivalent to a white noise model for $z_{2:N}= \Delta \data{y_{2:N}}$, apart from the issue of initialization.

\ei

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{The random walk with drift}
\bi
\item The \myemph{random walk with drift} model is given by the difference equation

\vspace{2mm}

[M6] $\quad\quad\quad Y_n = Y_{n-1} + \mu + \epsilon_n$,

\vspace{2mm}

driven by a white noise process $\{\epsilon_n\}$. This has solution
$$ Y_n = Y_0 + n\mu + \sum_{k=1}^n\epsilon_k.$$

\item Here, $\mu$ is the mean of the \myemph{increments} rather than the random walk process itself.

\item As for the random walk without drift, we must define $Y_0$ to initialize the model and complete the model specification. Unless otherwise specified, we usually initialize with $Y_0=0$.

\ei
