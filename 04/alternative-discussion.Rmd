In Chapter 4, we saw that AR(2) models can describe quasi-periodic oscillatory behavior, with an autocorrelation function (ACF) that is an exponentially decaying sinusoid.

You could experiment with `ARMAacf()` to find parameter values $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ for a causal AR(2) model that does not have a sinusoidal oscillation in its ACF. Instead, the ACF should decay to zero similar to an AR(1) model.

Can you say anything about the class of all AR(2) models that do not have any oscillatory behavior? One way to address this in the context of Chapter 4 is to work out when a deterministic skeleton decays with no oscillations. In physics and engineering, this is called an over-damped system.
