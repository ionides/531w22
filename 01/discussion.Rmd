Here are some results that show the consequences of extending the Michigan January low temperature analysis from 2019 to 2021.

```{r compare}
y <- read.table(file="ann_arbor_weather.csv",header=1)
arma2021 <- arima(y$Low, order=c(1,0,1))
arma2021
arma2019 <- arima(y$Low[y$Year<=2019], order=c(1,0,1))
arma2019

```

These results may be a bit surprising. Why? Can you interpret them based on what we saw in class: plotting the data, writing the equation for the ARMA(1,1) model, and understanding that `arima()` carries out maximum likelihood estimation?
